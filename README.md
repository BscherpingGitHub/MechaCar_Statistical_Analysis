## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
1. The vehicle_length and ground_clearance show signs of non-random amoutn of variance to the dataset. Whereas, vehicle weight,
spoiler angle, and all wheel drive show random amount of variance. 
2. The P-value is below our assumed significance level of 0.05% (5.35e-11). Therefore, there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis and the
slope is not zero. 
3. The r-squred value is 0.7149 which tells this model predictions are 71.5% accurate to the mpg of MechaCar prototypes. This above 70% would be a good representation of the mpg of MechCar prototypes.
